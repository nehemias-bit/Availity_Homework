### 1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.
> Like with many, there are a lot of things I am proud of. One of my proudest moments would be when I graduated the US Army Ranger School. This is considered one the most physically, mentally, and emotionally, taxing training experiences anyone could have so I am very proud to be a member of that community. 

### 2.	Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
> I recently read Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian. He uses historical data, and case studies to show that Universal Basic Income, Open Borders, and a 15-hour Workeek is possible and makes sense. Sounds crazy, but its very interesting.  

### 3.	How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?
> I would say that Availity is a company that writes the computer programs that allow Doctors to communicate with the health insurance company of the patient. These programs help speed up hospital visits for patients and prevents many unnecessary headaches for everyone.
